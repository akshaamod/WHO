Conducting Analysis of the given dataset. Creating Linear Regression Model, using SkitLearn and StatsModel, to predict the LifeExpectancy.
Creating a Function using our model that predicts the life expectancy given new data from the user. The function takes into account data sensitivity and so uses two models - a normal one (asks for sensitive information from user) and a more ethical one (doesn't ask for sensitive information).
