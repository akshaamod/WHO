# WHO
## Overview
The aim of this project was to create a function that predicts the life expectancy of a population given some data from the user. To do this we started of with some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We then created two Linear Regression Model, using SkitLearn and StatsModel, to predict the life expectancy. The difference between the two different models is in the data they use to make the prediction. One takes sensitive information whilst the other doesn't (i.e. a more ethical one). We the used all this to create the function that takes into account data sensitivity.
